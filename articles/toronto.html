            It was some late summer day, 2014. I was seven years old, my mom was driving me and my four-year-old sibling to visit her parents in Toronto. We slogged along the Gardiner in afternoon traffic – cars on each side with the city visible above us, the lake in the distance – when my mom noticed one car in particular, with a peculiar license plate: “MRDECO”. Now, you might ask, why is this interesting to me? Someone had an odd license plate, perhaps some old nickname, what else is there to it? I’ll get to that, just hear me out.
            </p>
            <p>
            2014 was a crossroads for Toronto. Mayor Rob Ford, the flamboyant populist whose crack cocaine use was the subject of worldwide mockery, had spent the last four years stonewalling transit projects and dodging his own personal scandals, with very few actual accomplishments to his name. I, of course, did not know about the politics of it at the time, but I was quite aware of Rob Ford. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My mom grew up in Toronto, in East York. Her parents still live in the affluent suburb “Leaside”, near Bayview and Eglinton. Rob Ford was a family joke, someone I heard laughed at around the dinner table or in the car. I had seen his name on my mom’s Facebook feed a few times, and certainly in the newspaper at my grandparents’ house. My grandparents are conservatives, and probably didn’t object too much to Ford’s political agenda, but they certainly have a distaste for his personality and the joke he made of the mayor’s office – essentially, they’re the archetypal John Tory voter.
            </p>
            <p>
            John Tory and Olivia Chow were Ford’s two opponents. Tory, a former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives and the campaign manager for Kim Campbell’s disastrous federal campaign in 1993, ran on “common sense” and economic competence (which essentially means being exactly the same as Ford on policy, just without the abrasiveness or the rule-breaking), and at first polled a distant third, but soon made it into the lead. Olivia Chow was the federal NDP MP for the downtown riding of Trinity–Spadina. An immigrant from Hong Kong, she was married to Jack Layton until his untimely death in 2011. Chow ran on progressive transit policy and campaigned as a voice of Toronto’s downtown, who had been categorically ignored by city governments since amalgamation. Chow led the polls for several months, but fell to third by the end.
            </p>
            <p>
            The election was set. It would be the moderate conservative John Tory and the progressive Olivia Chow against the right-wing populist Rob Ford, who, despite his various political missteps, still commanded a base of disaffected voters in Toronto’s suburbs, who saw him as a voice for the “little guy” who fought for fiscal responsibility and “respect for taxpayers”.
            </p>
            <p>
            But then, something changed – Rob Ford was hospitalized for cancer and had to drop out. Ever persistent, he ran instead for his old council seat in Etobicoke, but there was just no way for him to continue his mayoral campaign. He was replaced on the ballot by his brother, whom you may have heard of – Doug Ford.
            </p>
            <p>
            And that car? That was the man himself, Douglas Robert Ford Jr., “MRDECO” being a reference to Deco Labels, the printing business he inherited from his father.
            </p>
            <p>
            John Tory would win the election and Olivia Chow would fade into the background, while Doug Ford made his grand comeback four years later, becoming premier.
            </p>
            <p>
            While intertwining with me, this is the story of modern Toronto. How its voters, predominantly in the suburbs, chose a path of least-resistance, a return to the status quo instead of a bold vision for the future. Since amalgamation, Toronto has been held hostage by the suburbs. The suburbs who elected a man like Rob Ford because they thought just a little bit too much of their money was being spent on transit and housing instead of bulldozing more of downtown to build another highway. This was a chance for the people of Toronto to stand up, to take back their city from the developers and the gatekeepers, from the motorists who will fight to the grave against anything that would even slightly inconvenience drivers. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I love Toronto. It’s a place with so much history, so much spirit, and so much potential. The joy I get from sitting down on a TTC subway, watching the streetcars, biking along the lake downtown, or simply looking around at all of the people in Union Station holds a special place in my heart. For the last thirty years, various governments have been doing everything they can to tear down what makes Toronto special, to make it simply another GTA city, another Milton or Vaughan, another Oshawa or Mississauga. Toronto isn’t that. Toronto is a city for people, not drivers. A city for residents, not commuters.
            </p>
            <p>
            The suburbs may have won the battle, but they haven’t won the war. Downtown will have its turn – just you wait.
