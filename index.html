      <h1>TITLE HEADING</h1>
      <h4>In 1867, delegates from four of the British colonies on the American continent gathered in Charlottetown to establish a federation of the colonies to be known as “Canada”. The delegates represented thousands of people across a large section of what is now Canada, and every single one of them was a white European man. At the time, society, obviously, was designed to be for their benefit. That is a simple fact, a fact that explains exactly why the only people represented at the conferences of Confederation were from that group. The system of government implemented in Canada would have been significantly more effective had it considered the needs and viewpoints of women and the indigenous population of our country at the time of its establishment.

No group in Canada have been treated anywhere nearly as poorly as those who have always been here, our indigenous people, known at the time of Confederation as “Indians”. Canada has committed numerous atrocities against its indigenous population, from forced-sterilization of Indigenous as recently as the 1970s, to state-sanctioned residential schools in which children were taken from their families and subjected to horrible abuse, along with being taught to regard their family and community as practicing some “backwards” and “uncivilized” culture. The United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide outlined the definition of genocide in 1948. One of the forms of genocide included was “imposing measures to prevent births within the group” (United Nations, 1948). This means that Canada committed literal genocide as recently as 1972. I know many people who were alive in 1972. Had the First Nations people of Canada been included in the establishment of our country, there would certainly have been laws established banning these practices; there would definitely have been regulations enacted which disallowed the exploitation of Indigenous land for the extraction of natural resources; and the government of Canada would absolutely not have allied with the Church to rip children away from their families and culture, subjecting them to unimaginable abuse at the hands of the state.

	Furthermore, a subgroup that makes up a majority of the world population, 50.4 per-cent, was entirely excluded from every single Confederation conference. I am, of course, referring to women. For centuries, western societies have adopted a patriarchal order, and Canada is no exception. Women at the time were seen as an extension of their husband or father, as property, as if their only value as people was based on how many children they had and how well they maintained their husband’s home. Actually, women were not even considered to be people under Canadian law until 1929, when the Committee of the Privy Council overturned a decision by the Supreme Court to maintain their separate legal status, declaring them to be, in fact, “persons” (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2006). It is incredible to me that a majority of people in Canada were denied basic human rights for 62 years, and denied many other rights for far longer. This is for one very simple reason, which is that the Canadian federation was established to favour those in power at the time. In creating a structure for the society, they prioritized their own interests, and those who did not fall into their groups were cast aside. 

It is obvious that if these groups, women and the indigenous people of our continent, had been represented at the time of our government’s creation, Canada would have addressed the needs of every single citizen through its policies, rather than simply those who were the dominant class of the time. Canada’s First Nations people have faced unimaginable oppression, they were subjected to genocide, and it was completely legal. Women were denied basic rights for decades after our country’s founding. Still, even today, both of those groups face discrimination on the basis of inherent factors which they have no control over. Thankfully, over the 154 years since the Confederation conferences, Canada has been able to fix many of these injustices, but we still have a long way to go. One day, all Canadians will be seen as equals.
