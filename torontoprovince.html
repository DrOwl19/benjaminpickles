    <p>
Toronto is Canada’s largest and most populous city, and I believe that it should become our eleventh province. With a population of 2.7 million, Toronto has more residents than nine of Canada’s thirteen provinces and territories. It is clearly not reasonable for a region with almost thrice the citizens of Prince Edward Island to not have self-governance.     </p>
    <p>
Furthermore, Toronto is severely underrepresented in the House of Commons. Toronto has one MP for approximately every 110,000 citizens. In comparison, there is one member of parliament for every 40,000 citizens in PEI, 74,000 in Newfoundland and Labrador, 78,000 in New Brunswick, 84,000 in Saskatchewan, 89,000 in Nova Scotia, and 98,000 in Manitoba. Provincehood for Toronto would force the Government of Canada to prioritize better parliamentary representation for the region. 
    </p>
    <p>
Finally, Toronto has a larger economy than six of Canada’s provinces, behind Alberta. This means that a Toronto which is independent from Ontario would be able to sustain itself, and likely would be able to spend more of its money on helping its citizens. Right now, the provincial tax dollars of Torontonians are mostly used outside of the city. 
    </p>
    <p>
In conclusion, it is clear that provincehood for Toronto would lead to self-governance for 2.7 million people, fairer parliamentary representation, and the investment of its citizens’ provincial tax dollars in helping Toronto itself.
